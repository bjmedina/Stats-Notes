    "- __EX__: The NCES surveyed 4400 college graduates abou tthe length of time required to earn their bachelors. THe mean is 5.15 years, std is 1.68 years. __a.__ Construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for the mean time required by all college graduates. \n",
    "    - 4400 is a large enough sample size so that we can use the CLT.\n",
    "    - Assumptions:\n",
    "        - None, because of the CLT. \n",
    "    - Our interval is $ \\bar x \\pm Z_{\\dfrac \\alpha 2} * {\\dfrac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}}$<br><br>\n",
    "    - We have $\\bar x$, we have $z_{\\dfrac \\alpha 2}$, we don't have $\\sigma$, but we can use $s$.\n",
    "    - $ \\bar x \\pm z_{\\dfrac \\alpha 2} * {\\dfrac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}} = 5.15 \\pm 0.065$\n",
    "    - Interval is $(5.085, 5.215)$\n",
    "    - \"We are $99\\%$ confident that the mean time required by all college graduates is between $5.085$ years and $5.215$ years.\"\n",
    "        - _ALWAYS_ write this interpretation. <br><br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "- __b.__ Now, find 90% confidence interval for the mean time required by all college graduates. Will it be wider or narrower?\n",
    "    - $ \\bar x \\pm Z_{\\dfrac \\alpha 2} * {\\dfrac \\sigma {\\sqrt{n}}} = 5.15 \\pm 0.042$\n",
    "    - Interval is $(5.108, 5.192)$\n",
    "        - You can get $z_{\\dfrac \\alpha 2}$ by looking up the associated z value for $\\dfrac \\alpha 2$\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "---\n",
    "- The higher the confidence, the greater the chance that the CI contains the parameter.\n",
    "- High confidence coefficients are used in practice so the chance of error is small\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "---\n",
    "1. As n increases, the width of the interval gets __narrower__. \n",
    "2. As the confidence coefficient increases, the width __increases__ or __gets wider__. \n",
    "3. Is a 95% confidence interval wider or narrower than a 99% confidence interval? __Narrower__\n",

    "- Two problems with a small sample:\n",
    "    1. Shape of the sampling distribution now depends on the population that is sampled. \n",
    "        - __Solution__: If the original population is approximately normal, then the sampling distribution is normal. <br><br>\n",
    "    2. $s$ might not be a good estimator for $\\sigma$\n",
    "        - __Solution__: Use the student t distribution instead of the z distribution (page 817).\n",
    "        - $t = \\dfrac { \\bar x - \\mu } {\\dfrac s {\\sqrt n}}$\n",
    "            - _Looks a LOT like the z-score equation, huh?_\n",
    "            - _Note_: The t statistic is more variable than the z<br><br>\n",
    "            \n",
    "### Characteristics \n",
    "---\n",
    "1. __It's mound shaped.__ \n",
    "2. __Symmetric about 0.__ \n",
    "3. __More variable than the z.__\n",
    "4. __There are many t distributions to choose from depending on your degrees of freedom__ (df=n-1).\n",
    "5. __As $n \\rightarrow \\infty, t \\rightarrow z$__ (that's why the numbers at the bottom of the t table match the critical z values).\n",
    "6. $t_{\\dfrac \\alpha 2}$\n",

    "- 3 test scores with an average of 80. \n",
    "    - This says that 2 can be \"free\", but the third is fixed. \n",
    "    - __EX__: Test scores: 50, 100, __\n",
    "        - The first two test scores __DICTATE__ what the exam grade must be in order for you average to be an 80.<br><br>\n",

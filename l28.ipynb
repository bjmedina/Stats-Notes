    "- Allows you to choose a random sample of size $n$ that produces results that are within an acceptable distance from the population value. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As long as the sampling is executed properly, excellent estimates result from relatively small samples, no matter how large the population size\n",
    "    - Researchers have control over how much error there can be.\n",
    "    - The more precise you want to be, the larger the sample size must be. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- First, you must decide on a degree of precision (specify the sampling error)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, you must set your confidence level (the probability in which the specified precision is achieved). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample size for estimating means\n",

    "- $n = \\dfrac {z^2\\sigma^2} {SE^2}$,\n",

    "    - So, $n = \\dfrac{ {2.33}^2{7.5}^2 } { {2^2} } = 76.34$\n",
    "        - $\\therefore,\\  n = 77$, because we always round up.<br><br>\n",
    "---\n",
    "- To decrease the needed sample size $n$, you can: \n",
    "    1. Increase the __sampling error__. \n",
    "    2. Decrease the __confidence__. \n",
    "    3. You have no control over __the standard deviation__.<br><br>\n",

    "$\\rightarrow$ __Significance Test__: A way of testing a hypothesis by comparing the data to values predicted by the hypothesis\n",
    "- _Examples of hypotheses you can test_:\n",
    "    1. Normal body temperature is ${98.6}^\\circ$F\n",
    "    2. There is a difference between Democrats and Republicans in the probabilities that they vote with their party leadership\n",

    "0. __Assumptions and information__\n",
    "    - If you skip this and continue, you'll eventually have to start all over... So don't skip this.<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. __Null Hypotheses__ ($H_0$): \"Status quo\"; we believe it to be true unless data provide convincing evidence that it is false (claim)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Alternative Hypothesis__ ($H_a$): That which we believe only if the data provide convincing evidence of its truth (It is usually what the researcher is trying to show). \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. __Test Statistic__: Relative standing of sample data; will be a $z, t$, or $S$\n",
    "    - $S$ is the median test\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Rejection Region__ or __p-value__: Values of the test statistic for which we will reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Conclusion__ (in terms of the question):\n",
    "    1. \"There is sufficienct evidence to reject $H_0$...\"<br>\n",

    "> ***NOTE***: $\\beta$ is usually `impossible` to compute, so we wont do it. So, we do not say \"Accept $H_0$\" because computing $\\beta$ is difficult and usually unknown.\n",

    "3. __We will not cover Section 8.7, which is computing $\\beta$__<br>\n",
    "4. __Type I and Type II errors are inversely related - the smaller the $\\alpha$, the larger the $\\beta$__\n",
    "5. __To keep both probabilities at a low level, we must select large sample sizes__\n",

    "In this chapter, we will estimate population parameters such as means and proportions based on a single sample selected from the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Two types of estimators:\n",
    "    1. __Point Estimator__ - consists of a single number calculated from the data that is the best guess for the parameter\n",
    "    2. __Interval Estimator__ - Consists of a range around the point estimator, within which the parameter is believed to fall. <br><br>\n",

    "$\\rightarrow$ Confidence Intervals indicate the probable accuracy of the estimate (\"We are $95\\%$ confident that...\")<br>\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ The accuracy depends on charactersitics of the sampling distribution of the estimator<br>\n",

    "- _Note_: How can you ensure that you have a smaller and smaller error?\n",
    "    - Bigger and bigger sample size!!\n",
    "---\n",
    "- __Confidence Coefficient__: The probability that the confidence interval contains the parameter (Usually a number close to 1, such as .95 or .99). If the coefficient is $.95$, then you are $95\\%$ confident and $5\\%$ not confident.\n",
    "    - The \"leftover\" is called $\\alpha$ and is located in the 2 tails of the distribution<br><br>\n",
    "- __Critical Value__: Number on the border separating statistics that are likely to occur from those that are unlikely to occur.\n",

    "    1. Either the interval captures the population parameter or it does not.\n",
    "    2. The confidence coefficient gives the probability of capturing the parameter.\n",
